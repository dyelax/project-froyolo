Piik 
=============

#### About ####

Piik is an anonymous photosharing app that displays images on map where they are taken. We wanted an app that allows users to freely share their pictures (whether cool university photos, or spur-of-the-moment selfies) in a way that makes sense. The app also let's you "up" and "down" photos, so highly-regarded photos will be displayed on the local map as larger than not-so-highly voted photos. With time, photos gradually lose their "upvotes" and will shrink away.

Piik is developed for iPhone and features a back-end written entirely in Ruby on Rails (using carrierwave for file i/o). This project was designed for YHack 2014.
